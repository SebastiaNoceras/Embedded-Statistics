# Description: This repostory is composed by 2 files: stats.h and stats.c. In these files there are written a few functions that can analyze an array of unsigned char data items and report analytics on the maximum, minimum, mean and median of the data set. In addition, the functions reorder the data from large to small and round all data to the nearest integer. Finally, there is a function that prints nicely all the data.
